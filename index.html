            <div class="content">    
                <p>It is proposed to use tea to create "Human Shushu" and "Green Shucha". The tea production and processing momentum is strong, the tea garden management is standardized, and the selection and promotion of fine varieties are strengthened.。

　 　<br />The first is to take the xx tea field as the leader and focus on creating Shu tea tea brands. XX Tea Farm invested 50,000 yuan to purchase and install 60 cubic meters of tea fresh-keeping warehouse, and purchased a set of 70-type tea killing machines and a single tea tree pruning machine, and put them into use. In order to facilitate the traffic in the park, 300 meters of roads in the park were renovated. XX Tea Farm is committed to the production of famous and superior teas. This year, a total of 5.5 tons of famous and superior teas were produced and sold, with an output value of more than 1 million yuan. At the same time, the development of summer and autumn tea was started, and new teas were developed according to market demand. In terms of tea tree selection and breeding, following the *** tea tree variety Shucha Zao and the new tea tree line Slope Green and Texiang early, a new line "No. 4" with excellent characteristics was bred.”　　

　　<br />Second, the situation of tea machinery processing is promising. Shucha Town went to winter and this spring to purchase two sets of tea processing machinery and a tea sliver maker. At present, there are 10 tea processing factories in our town that have begun to take shape. The processing capacity has increased significantly. With the reduction of tea production this year, the income of tea farmers has increased significantly.。　　

　　<br />The third is the management of tea gardens. This year, the tea farmers in the town purchased 5 tea tree pruning machines (12 existing ones). It is expected that in the near future, the tea habit of tea farmers in our town will be changed.。

　　<br />. As the benefits of tea increase, the desire of tea farmers to renew old tea gardens and to open new tea gardens has increased. The town party committee and government put forward the idea of ​​"one person, one acre old-age tea garden" in time, and initially planned to implement it in the tea garden village of Shucha Town.</p>
